Kinetic energy = 1/2 mass*(velocity^2)

k (thickness/diameter)^2 = 0.5*(mass/diameter^3)*Velocity^2

thickness/diameter = 0.30386*Diameter^0.25 * [mass/diameter^3) * velocity * C^2)]^0.625
C = a consstant, adjusted by hardness, ranging from 525(mild steel, 1136 BHN) to 804(Krupp Cemented, ?? BHN



penetration degrades when thickness is more than half the caliber


"Some portions of the nose of the projectile will continue forward, usually in one large piece, if not stopped by a bulkhead or deck, ranging from up to 33% (detonating filler) or 38% (non-detonating filler) of the projectile's pre-explosion body weight (the entire nose portion) for small-cavity AP projectiles, 25% (detonating) or 30% (non-detonating) for medium-sized cavity Common/SAP projectiles, and down to only 2% (any filler) of the projectile for very light-case, large-filler HE/HC-type nose-fuzed projectiles (only the nose fuze/nose plug and the projectile's ring-shaped nose portion screwed to it), even if a steel nose plug and base fuze are used in these last projectiles."
 ..Yes, be cause HE needs to do even more damage...
	..You never know, M, the armor overhaul might nerf HE somewhat...

He damage - the smaller the ratio of He mass to projectile mass - I.e. the thicker the casing walls around the filler - the greater the mass of shrapnel & lower shrapnel velocity

minimum armor thickness to stop shrapnel is 0.08 calibers for 1.4-3.5% HE by mass; 0.095 calibers for 3.5-5.99% HE by mass; and .11 calibers for 6% HE by mass

HE Projectile Armor Penetration Formula (http://www.navweaps.com/index_nathan/Miscarmr.php)

thickness = (2.576 * 10^-20)*Caliber*(velocity^5.6084)*Cos(2*angle-45)) + (0.156*diameter)

velocity is in feet/sec
angle is set to 45 if under 45 deg
thickness is the maximum armor thickness that recieves a caliber+ wide hole in plate from contact HE detonation
tl/DR; armor 0.156 calibers thick will get penned by detonation, and armor 0.1872 calibers thick to prevent armor cracking
hole in armor is rectangle caliber*projectile length
plates thinner than 0.156 calibers will gte begger holes, of course
half the thickness will have twice the size hole

if a HE round ahs penetrated (but perforated?) damage to armor is increased, can shatter more brittle plates (massive armor damage!)

kinetic impact - shattering increases effective thickness of plate by 30%, prevent riccochet, unless angle is greater than 55 deg, which makes it easier for shattered projectile to pen

higher vel will not prevent shatter, projctile will still go splat

projectile penetration:


QPused = (QPtable)[1 + (Ob3)(Cqtbl) - (Aqtbl)(Teff/D)(Ob3Bqtbl) - (LC)(Teff - Tmin)/D]

where:

    "QPused" is the value of the projectile quality factor to use in place of the tabulated value "QPtable" for that projectile.
    "Ob3" is equal to Ob in degrees up to 45°, but is set to a constant 45° if Ob is greater than 45° (deformation effects do not get worse at higher obliquity, but they do not get any better, either.)
    "Teff" is the effective STS thickness of the armor plate hit against penetration after its quality factor and, if applicable, laminated-plate formulae have been applied as specified above.
    "Tmin" is the minimum STS plate thickness at normal obliquity where damage effects on QPtable become evident.
    "LC", "Aqtbl", "Bqtbl", and "Cqtbl" are constants for that particular projectile for the particular QPused ballistic limit being calculated (Holing, Navy, Army, Effective, or Protection.)
