todo: 
Add laser-guided homing rockets?

-Status Effects
:Stunned? - pilot blinded, no input, inputs set to 0 for 5-10 sec
:GLOC- all inputs(throttle/crtl srf/weapon/etc) locked for 5-10 sec - see old 	EMP code, the ControlState s settings
:Bluescreen - everything off for 10 sec (current soft EMP status)


Battledamage todo - pilots eject from bricked craft
	

cook off - have fires add to part heat, have ammo have low heat tolerance

test engine balancing
test fires adding heat

Potential ammo types/list of possible types
Bullets:
AP-standard slug, bonus to anything requiring penetration
HE-AoE splash, can ignite fuel, bonus to tings daamged by shrapnel/concussion
Inciniary-Guaranteed fuel ignition, bonus to actuator daamge, low DoT?
BlueScreen-EMP buildup if hits cockpit
Acid-Armor damage?

Rockets:

Seeker-Laser guidance. Look into ways to counter (find a way to make rockets targetable?)
Hive-Jericho style multimissile
Inferno - attaches a fire w/ DoT
	- may need to split fire effects and FX so inferno fires don't cunsume fueltank contents, etc.

enable underwater operation?
underwater could be determined by FlightGlobals.GetAltitude(rocket.transform.position), have thrust reduced, drag increased
Could also do the same for bullets, have bullets stop at water surface like IRL, underwater bullets move much slower, greater drag


implement adjustable floor for engine thrust for BD thrust reduction
implement adjustable cutoff point for when engines flame out from BD

increase Ho series and R4M FX size for AA

look into reload anim missile rail


new guns to add to ?BDA-E? to showcase new functionality
Bolt gun, for rocket-firing guns
multi-laser - for scatter pulse laser

something to showcase crewed weapons
TeslaCannon - new emp functionality

Armor Overhaul Changelog
-Armor now has mass
-Armor now has cost
-Adds Multiple armor materials
-Adds BD_ArmorDef for armor material templates
-Parts now have armor limits, determined by size; no more sticking 1500mm of armor on a basic Fin; this can be overridded via MM or .cfg value
-Rework of ballistic and laser damage
-laser damage now mitigated by armor Diffusivity value
-ballistic damage determined by armor material strength, hardness, density, and ductility.
-Armor spalling implemented; just does extra damage to hit part for now
-Armorplates now scalable with module BDAAdjustableArmor
==BDAAdjustableArmor has one configurable field; ArmorTransformName; the default is ArmorRootTransform
