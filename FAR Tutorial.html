a plane in FAR is no different than in stock - CoL behind the CoM,
wheels just behind the CoM, try to have fuel tanks placed so that CoM
moves forward as fuel drains, remember to have proper control surface
inputs for the control surfaces, etc. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">	Where
FAR differs from stock is the level of granularity of the aerodynamic
model being used, the level of control the user has in tweaking and
tuning a design the method of calculating lift, and the data the user
gets from the editor about how their craft will perform. In the stock
game, adding wing parts and an engine is all you need (usually) to
make something that will fly. FAR is a bit more complicated. FAR
looks not at the number of wings you have bolted onto a craft, but
where the wing areas are, and how large they are. Wings that are
clipped into a fuselage will be ignored, and wings clipped into each
other will be viewed as one wing, not multiple. Additionally, wings
with insufficient vertical separation (wing stacking) will impart a
malus to lift, similar to real-life. FAR, when looking at total lift
and drag of a craft, uses a Voxel-based system to calculate the
aerodynamics of the craft as a whole, rather than simply adding up
all the lift produced by wing parts on the craft and seeing if the
lift value is enough to counter gravity. Blended body designs will
exhibit the body lift you'd expect them to, craft with all sorts of
lumps or protrusions will have higher drag, etc, and FAR takes
area-ruling into account when calculating trans-sonic and supersonic
drag. Finally, the settings on control surfaces matter much more &ndash;
in Stock you can get away with all control surfaces left on default
Pitch/Yaw/Roll settings, but in FAR you'll want to specify what axis
each control surface responds to. That said, if a craft built with
FAR looks like a plane, it will likely fly like one. But how
well?<BR><BR>	FAR includes a number of tools to get a detailed
technical look at how your craft will perform; use of these tools
isn't required or necessary. They provide diagnostic feedback on
flight performance, before it's even left the SPH. They are
completely optional, but they can help enormously, either for fine
tuning, or helping someone new to FAR better understand why their
plane is or isn't performing.<BR>	Clicking on the FAR icon on the
toolbar in the Editor brings up the FAR Analysis window. This window
has several sub-windows that all display information about different
aspects of the craft's flight-worthiness.<BR><A HREF="https://i.imgur.com/IWDBqru.png"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><IMG SRC="https://i.imgur.com/IWDBqru.png" NAME="graphics1" ALT="IWDBqru.png" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=660 HEIGHT=449 BORDER=1></FONT></A><BR><BR>Here

The Yellow line is a measure of Pitch movement, and can be read as an
indication of craft stability. Ideally, this value decreases as AoA
increases, such a craft will want to return to a neutral AoA in the
absence of Pitch inputs; an increasing value as AoA increases means
the craft has pitch instability &ndash; it will want to lawn dart or
stall in the absence of control surface Pitch inputs; this is
generally undesirable.<BR>Here, the example craft is fairly stable,
at least up to 40 degrees AoA.<BR>-</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><B>Red

allows tweaking the mass of the wing or control surface. This in
important, for FAR models aero stresses and aero failures &ndash; in
other words, pull a hard turn with wings that aren't sufficiently
sturdy, and the aero forces exerted on the plane during the turn will
rip the wing off. Heavier wings are stronger, and can higher Gee
turns. That said, default Mass-Strength is somewhat heavy &ndash; the
example craft has a mass of ~4200 kg with all wing parts at 1.0;
reducing M-S Mult to 0.5 dropped the craft weight to ~3500kg. The
lower the strength, the less aerostress the wing can tolerate before
failing, but the lower the mass, the less the overall mass of the
craft, and the less wing loading. Finding the ideal setting may take
some trial and error, but main wings and control surfaces with more
than 10 degrees of deflection should probably remain above
0.5.<BR><BR>Tuning control settings can take some time. Setting
inputs too low results in a reduction of maneuverability. Conversely,
setting them too high runs the risk of the control surface stalling
at full deflection, resulting in a loss of control, which may
translate to overall degraded aircraft performance or sudden
oscillations as the craft reacts to the sudden reduction in control
authority on that axis. Also of note is the effect of speed on
control surface performance. At higher speeds, aeropressures increase
on deployed surfaces. A control surface that could fully deploy
without incident at low speed may undergo more aerostress than it can
handle and break, or result in the craft undergoing too great a
vector change, resulting in increased drag and unwanted energy
loss.<BR><BR>	So you've built a plane, tweaked it, and have now
launched it. As mentioned earlier, if a craft looks like a plane,
chances are it will fly like one. But what if it doesn&rsquo;t? Some
things to check, then. What is the Lift Coefficient of the aircraft,
and what AoA is required to generate lift at takeoff conditions? If
the Lift coefficient is small, consider increasing the wing area of
the craft by adding more wing, or reducing the mass of the craft. The
other option is increasing craft thrust - higher thrust can get away
with smaller wings, and vice -versa. If the AoA required is high,
consider adding some Angle of Incidence to the main wing &ndash; AoI
is the measure of the angle of the main wing compared to the
fuselage, with the leading edge of the wing higher than the trailing
edge (usually). Be careful when adding AoI, as more than a few
degrees of tilt to the wing may result in needing negative AoA at
higher speeds to maintain level flight, as well as adding unnecessary
drag. If both cL and AoA are acceptable, check CoM and Landing gear
placement. If going for a modern tricycle arrangement, are the rear
wheels just behind the CoM to permit the aircraft to pivot the nose
up during takeoff? If going for a inverse tricycle arrangement, are
the main wheels providing enough elevation relative to the rear wheel
to add some extrinsic Angle of Incidence when the craft is a rest or
taking off?<BR>If the craft is yawing left or right on the runway
during liftoff, are your landing gears on straight? non-perpendicular
wheels can behave oddly. If your gears are fine, is the craft Yaw
stable at low speed? If not, try a wider wheel base or larger
tail/greater yaw authority.<BR><BR>	Once the craft is airborne, do
the control surface deflection settings permit a level of response
appropriate to the craft? Most turns are accomplished by rolling,
then pitching, rather than via yaw; Does the craft have a good roll
rate, and sufficient pitch authority? If not, consider increasing
either control surface deflection or more/larger control surfaces. Is
the CoM more or less centered on the main wing to permit the craft to
easily rotate around it for pitch maneuvers? If using a
multi-fueslage design, is the CoM centered with the Center of Thrust,
and/or is there sufficient dihedral or tailplane area to prevent
sideslip and yaw?</SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">
